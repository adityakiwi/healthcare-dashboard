# Healthcare Dashboard
Welcome! This is our Senior Team Project for the University of San Francisco. 

We used React, D3, and ChartJS to build a Healthcare Dashboard website to visualize data from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database in a simple and interactive way. The Dashboardâ€™s visualization capabilities provide easy access to clinical data for healthcare researchers, hospital administrators, and data enthusiasts who do not have a computer science background, for example individuals seeking to obtain insights from correlations between different clinical variables or through other data-based analyses that can be visualized.

Feel free to chechout our website [here](http://healthcaredashboard.io/)
